Major Dependencies:
OpenCV: OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems. Python is a general purpose programming language started by Guido van Rossum that became very popular very quickly, mainly because of its simplicity and code readability.
Pygame: Pygame is a free and open-source cross-platform library for the development of multimedia applications like video games using Python
Install dlib: Dlib is a popular toolkit for machine learning that is used primarily for computer vision and image processing tasks, such as face recognition, facial landmark detection, object detection, and more.
Numpy: NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. 
Scipy: SciPy is an open-source Python library which is used to solve scientific and mathematical problems. It is built on the NumPy extension and allows the user to manipulate and visualize data with a wide range of high-level commands.
Install Imutiles: Imutils is a collection of convenience functions to make basic image processing tasks with OpenCV in Python easier. It is designed to simplify common tasks such as resizing images, rotating images, displaying images in a window, and working with video streams.

Note!!!
shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file is missing due to restriction in github you want to install seperate you can use following command to get this file : https://huggingface.co/spaces/asdasdasdasd/Face-forgery-detection/blob/ccfc24642e0210d4d885bc7b3dbc9a68ed948ad6/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat
